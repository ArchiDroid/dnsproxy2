dnsproxy2 - a replacement DNS proxy for Android 4.3+

This currently allows the user to manually override the DNS server IP,
and it sets the correct UID on outbound requests so they can be filtered
via iptables / AFWall+ / DroidWall / etc.


Requirements:

Root access

Write access to /system

/etc/init.d (if you want to start it on boot)


Build instructions:

1) Install NDK r8e under /opt/android-ndk

2) Run /opt/android-ndk/ndk-build

3) Binaries are under libs/.  Most devices will use libs/armeabi-v7a/


Installation instructions:

Make sure adb is in your PATH and functional, then on your PC host run:

bash misc/install.sh

This installs /system/xbin/dnsproxy2 and /etc/init.d/20dnsproxy2

To uninstall, remount /system read-write and delete those files.
